# Navigation Fix - Category Links Now Working!

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Category Navigation Links

### What Was Wrong

When clicking on category links (Electronics, Fashion, Sports), the page wouldn't filter the products correctly.

### What Was Fixed

Added proper URL parameter tracking in `ProductsPage.jsx` so that:

- Clicking "Electronics" → Shows only electronics products
- Clicking "Fashion" → Shows only fashion products
- Clicking "Sports" → Shows only sports products
- Clicking "Home & Garden" → Shows only home products
- Clicking "All Products" → Shows all products

       search: searchFromUrl,
     }));
